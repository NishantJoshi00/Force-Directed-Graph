# Force Directed Graph

## Using [Processing](https://processing.org/)

This is a simualtion similar to the the original concept of the [Force Directed Graph](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force-directed_graph_drawing)

\
But here the forces that are used are non-convergent causing constant deformation of the graph.

## Requirements
- Basic Java knowledge (Isn't that obvious)
- The latest version of Processing supporting your operation system


---

> Goal:
>
> - Optimize the implementation of the simulation.
> - Making is easily accessable to everyone to tinker with it.
